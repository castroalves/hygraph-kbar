# Command + K interface for Hygraph

Are you tired of clicking around Hygraph sections? Me too! That's why I've created this command+k interface for Hygraph.

## How to Install

1. Download the latest ZIP version in the [releases/](tree/main/releases) folder
2. Extract it
3. Open Chrome Browser
4. Click on the **Extensions** icon, then go to **Manage Extensions**
5. Click on the **Load Unpacked** button
6. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the ZIP file
7. Voila!

Now, go to any Hygraph project and hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> (Windows/Linux)!
